## @randamu/blocklock-solidity

This repository contains the Solidity-based smart contracts library that facilitates Randamu's on-chain timelock encryption and decryption.

By leveraging this library, developers can implement time-based data unlocking mechanisms securely in their smart contracts.

This library is designed with modularity and simplicity in mind, allowing developers to extend and integrate it into their existing projects easily.

### Features
* Timelock Encryption: Encrypt data that can only be decrypted after a specified block number.
* Decryption Callback: Implement custom logic that gets triggered when decryption occurs.
* Abstract Interface: Extend and implement the library to suit your specific needs.
